Bluetooth technology has evolved over time, resulting in several different standards. The main ones are:

    Bluetooth 1.0 and 1.0B
    Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)
    Bluetooth 3.0 + HS (High Speed)
    Bluetooth 4.0 (Low Energy)
    Bluetooth 4.1
    Bluetooth 4.2
    Bluetooth 5.0
    
Bluetooth 4.1, released in 2013, was an incremental update to the Bluetooth 4.0 standard. It added several new features and improvements, including:

    Improved connection setup times, reducing the time it took to establish a connection between devices.
    Enhanced data transfer reliability, making it more reliable to transfer data between devices.
    Increased coexistence with other wireless technologies, reducing the risk of interference with other wireless signals.
    Improved privacy and security features, providing better protection of personal data during transfer.

Bluetooth 4.1 was a step forward in the development of Bluetooth technology, offering improvements to performance, reliability, and security. This standard is still in use today in many devices and continues to be a widely recognized and popular wireless communication technology.

Bluetooth 4.2, released in 2014, was another incremental update to Bluetooth technology that introduced several new features and improvements. The main additions and enhancements of Bluetooth 4.2 included:

    Increased data transfer speed: Bluetooth 4.2 improved the data transfer speed compared to previous Bluetooth standards.

    Internet Protocol Support (IPS): Bluetooth 4.2 added support for Internet Protocols, allowing devices to communicate with each other over the internet, as well as over short distances.

    Security enhancements: Bluetooth 4.2 added several new security features, including support for secure connections and enhanced privacy features.

    Energy Efficiency: Bluetooth 4.2 continued to focus on energy efficiency, making it an ideal choice for devices that require low power consumption.

Bluetooth 4.2 was a major step forward in the development of Bluetooth technology and continued to build on the strengths of previous Bluetooth standards. This standard is still in use today in many devices, providing fast and secure wireless communication capabilities.

Bluetooth 5.0, released in 2016, was the latest major update to Bluetooth technology at the time of my training data (2021). It brought several new features and enhancements, including:

    Increased data transfer speed: Bluetooth 5.0 doubled the data transfer speed compared to Bluetooth 4.2, providing faster and more efficient data transfer.

    Extended range: Bluetooth 5.0 improved the range of operation, allowing devices to communicate over greater distances compared to previous Bluetooth standards.

    Increased device support: Bluetooth 5.0 added support for more devices, allowing for greater device compatibility and flexibility.

    Improved data broadcasting: Bluetooth 5.0 introduced the ability to broadcast data to multiple devices simultaneously, making it ideal for IoT and location-based services.

Bluetooth 5.0 was a major step forward in the development of Bluetooth technology, providing faster and more efficient communication capabilities, extended range, and improved device support. This standard continues to be widely used today in many devices, providing a versatile and reliable wireless communication technology.



Each new standard brought enhancements such as increased data transfer speeds, lower power consumption, and improved security features.
