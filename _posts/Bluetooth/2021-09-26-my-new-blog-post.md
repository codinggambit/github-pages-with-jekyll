Bluetooth technology has evolved over time, resulting in several different standards. The main ones are:

    Bluetooth 1.0 and 1.0B
    Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)
    Bluetooth 3.0 + HS (High Speed)
    Bluetooth 4.0 (Low Energy)
    Bluetooth 4.1
    Bluetooth 4.2
    Bluetooth 5.0
    
Bluetooth 1.0 and 1.0B were the first versions of Bluetooth technology released in 1999. They provided basic wireless communication capabilities, allowing devices to connect and transfer data over short distances. However, they had several limitations such as low data transfer speeds, limited device compatibility, and a limited range of operation. These early versions of Bluetooth technology were not widely adopted and have since been largely replaced by newer, more advanced standards.

Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR, released in 2004, was a significant improvement over the previous Bluetooth 1.0 and 1.0B standards. The "EDR" component of the standard referred to Enhanced Data Rate, which offered faster data transfer speeds and improved overall performance. Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR also improved upon the device compatibility and range of operation, making it a more viable option for a wider range of devices and applications. This standard is still in use today in some older devices, but has largely been replaced by newer, more advanced Bluetooth standards.

Bluetooth 3.0 + HS, released in 2009, brought further improvements to Bluetooth technology. The "HS" component of the standard stands for High Speed, and it allowed for faster data transfer speeds compared to previous Bluetooth standards. Additionally, Bluetooth 3.0 + HS introduced the concept of "Piconets" which allowed multiple devices to connect to a single master device, increasing the number of devices that could be connected at once. Despite these improvements, Bluetooth 3.0 + HS was not widely adopted and has since been replaced by newer Bluetooth standards.

Bluetooth 4.0, released in 2010, introduced a new technology called "Bluetooth Low Energy" (LE) which was specifically designed for devices that required low power consumption. Bluetooth 4.0 allowed for the creation of devices that could run for extended periods of time on small batteries, making it ideal for wearable technology and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Bluetooth 4.0 also offered improved data transfer speeds and increased device compatibility compared to previous Bluetooth standards. This standard is still in use today in many devices and is widely recognized as a major step forward in the development of Bluetooth technology.



Each new standard brought enhancements such as increased data transfer speeds, lower power consumption, and improved security features.
