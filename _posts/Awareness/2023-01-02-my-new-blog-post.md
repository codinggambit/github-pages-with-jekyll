Why do people buy irrelevant items when using voice product search?

Voice product search refers to the use of voice assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri, to search for and purchase products online. One reason why people might buy irrelevant items using voice product search is due to the lack of visual cues. When shopping online or in a physical store, consumers are able to see and touch the products they are considering purchasing, which can help them make more informed decisions. With voice product search, consumers do not have this same level of visual information, which can lead to misunderstandings or incorrect assumptions about the product they are purchasing.  

Another reason why people might buy irrelevant items using voice product search is due to the convenience factor. Voice assistants make it easy for consumers to shop without having to physically go to a store or even pull out their phone or computer. This convenience can lead people to make impulsive or spur-of-the-moment purchases that they might not have made if they had to go through more steps or put more thought into the process.  

In addition, the use of voice commands to search for and purchase products can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications between the consumer and the voice assistant. For example, the consumer might use ambiguous or unclear language when searching for a product, or the voice assistant might misinterpret the consumer's request due to background noise or other factors. This can result in the consumer being presented with and purchasing a product that is not what they intended to buy.  

There are several strategies that companies can use to try and reduce the number of irrelevant purchases made through voice product search. One approach is to provide more detailed and accurate product information to the voice assistant, so that it can better understand and fulfill consumers' requests. Another strategy is to use personalized recommendations and other targeted marketing techniques to try and steer consumers towards products that are more relevant to their interests and needs.  

Overall, the use of voice product search is still a relatively new and evolving field, and it is likely that both consumers and companies will continue to encounter and address issues related to irrelevant purchases. By understanding the underlying factors that can contribute to these types of purchases and implementing strategies to mitigate them, companies can help to improve the overall shopping experience for consumers using voice assistants.
