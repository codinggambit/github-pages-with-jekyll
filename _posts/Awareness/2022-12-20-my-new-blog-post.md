10 things to focus on for being a Good Candidate 

    Prepare in advance: Research the company and the position, as well as the person you will be interviewing. Make a list of questions to ask and bring copies of your resume and any other relevant documents.

    Dress appropriately: Wear professional attire that is appropriate for the company and position.

    Arrive on time: Plan to arrive at least 10-15 minutes early to give yourself time to settle in and calm your nerves.

    Be friendly and confident: Greet the interviewer with a firm handshake and make eye contact. Answer questions confidently and try to relax and be yourself.

    Listen carefully: Pay attention to the questions being asked and take a moment to think before answering. Make sure to fully address the question and provide relevant examples.

    Ask questions: Show your interest in the company and the position by asking thoughtful questions. Avoid asking about salary or benefits too early in the process.

    Be honest: Don't try to exaggerate your skills or experience. It's better to be honest and genuine than to try to oversell yourself.

    Be positive: Keep a positive attitude and focus on your strengths and accomplishments. Avoid complaining or speaking negatively about past employers or colleagues.

    Follow up: Thank the interviewer for their time and consider sending a follow-up email or letter reiterating your interest in the position and highlighting your qualifications.

    Practice: Consider practicing with a friend or family member to get comfortable with the interview process and improve your communication skills.
