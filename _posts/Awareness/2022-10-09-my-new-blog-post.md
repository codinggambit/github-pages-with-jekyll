I have been trying to add a daily check in routine. It starts with defining regulation.

Self-regulation refers to the ability of individuals to control and manage their own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in order to meet personal and social goals. It involves setting and following rules, monitoring one's own actions, and making adjustments to meet desired outcomes. Self-regulation is important for personal and social success and is developed through various forms of learning and experience throughout life.

Emotion self-regulation refers to the process of managing and regulating one's emotions, including the way they experience and express their feelings. This can involve techniques such as mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal, distraction, and stress management to help individuals manage their emotional responses to various events or stimuli. Effective emotion self-regulation can lead to improved well-being and better interpersonal relationships, as well as increased resilience and flexibility in the face of stress or adversity.

It also refers to the process of controlling and managing one's emotional responses. This involves the ability to identify, understand, and manage one's own emotions, as well as to effectively communicate with others. It is an important aspect of psychological well-being and is linked to a range of positive outcomes, such as improved mental health, better relationships, and enhanced problem-solving skills. Strategies for emotion self-regulation include mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal, relaxation techniques, and problem-solving skills.
