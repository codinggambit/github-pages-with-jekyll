I am planning on creating more content for people looking for Jobs with my previous experiences and hopefully with others who can help share too. 

I wanted to request both Job Seekers and Mentors to help join the Facebook group I created in helping others with the same.  

A couple of things to mention:  
i. Why Facebook?   It has more configurability and easier to setup  
ii. Why Now?   It is imminent that people reach out and lend out a hand with all things ongoing today.  

Please reach out to me [here](mailto:jobhuntingduringtoughtimes@gmail.com)  

I loved the insight and here is the [blog](http://www.onedayonejob.com/)  

And here is the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3190591167643415) you definitely want to check out
