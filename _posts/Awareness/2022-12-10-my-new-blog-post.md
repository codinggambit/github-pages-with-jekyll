Your questions answered  

*Mostly the question is around area you stayed. Safe enough for family to stay? Did you drive around yourself or taxi/uber?*  
Barbados is very safe
It all depends on how much you want to travel
I drove around
But the only caveat is that the roads aren’t great
I would recommend getting Insurance because accidents/tire damage repairs are pretty expensive

*Travel Options:*  
There is no Uber or Lyft
They have local shared cabs
If you want private cabs that would be more expensive
If you aren’t traveling too much then I would not rent a car

*This is a local transit app*  
[BeepBus App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beepbus-barbados-transit/id1413560928)

I would suggest downloading *Google maps Offline*  
And just routing it once from point A to B when connected to Wi-Fi
And then you are good to go

*Currency:*  
They accept US currency
So no need to buy Barbados dollars
And carry cash with you

*Time:*  
And you got passport back on 3rd day? → 3rd Business Day after Visa Appointment 
*Reason:*
And I had paid for express
So they sent it to the DHL express location

Safe to plan around 7 *Business days* after Appointment 

*Stages of Visa Issue:*  
*Where to check?*  
You may check the status of your visa application by going to the U.S. Department of State’s [website](https://ceac.state.gov/ceac/)

*  Click on “Check My Visa Application Status”  
* Select Visa Application Type: Nonimmigrant Visa NIV  
* Select from the dropdown menu the location your application was submitted to: Barbados, Bridgetown  
* Type in the Application ID:  
* Click “ Submit”  
* A dialog box will pop up containing the most recent information regarding your case.  


Please wait at least three business days following your visa interview to check on the status of your application. The system may not have updated the status of your application prior to that time, and thus the message you receive may not reflect the actual status of your application.  

So different status of visa as it transitions on the website:  
Applied  
Approved  
Issued  

*Maps with Bookmarked Locations:*  
[Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WFLJmZp5UWf7YFxZ7?g_st=com.tinyspeck.chatlyio.share)  

Just make sure to go to the embassy a day before to confirm where it is  

*Stay*:  
And lookup places on Expedia there are short term house rentals available  
There is no point investing a lot of money in the fancy resorts  

*Things not to miss:*  
Don’t forget to try their rum and coconut water  
And if you are a fan of cricket don’t miss Kensington Oval  

*Things to get:*  
SIM card from Flowmobile/Digicell  
If renting a car, you will get rental permit from the rental car agency at the airport  

*Weather:*  
Hot all year round and rain [random bouts of rain]  
Carry a raincoat
