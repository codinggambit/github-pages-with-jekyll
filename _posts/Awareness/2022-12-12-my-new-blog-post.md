Preparedness for Emergency

The Washington Emergency Management Division has created a work group of preparedness partners to collaborate and sync the preparedness messaging across the state. To participate, you'll need access to our BaseCamp hosted by our partners at CREW. Request using this form. Not everyone who requests access will be granted access. This is a work group for people working for specific organizations, not for the public as a large. For public preparedness tips, visit mil.wa.gov/preparedness
