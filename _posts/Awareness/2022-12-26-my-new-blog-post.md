There are several algorithms that are commonly used in artificial intelligence (AI) for search, including the following:

    Breadth-First Search (BFS): This is an algorithm that is used to traverse a tree or graph data structure. It starts at the root node and explores all the nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.  

    Depth-First Search (DFS): This is another algorithm that is used to traverse a tree or graph data structure. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

    A* Search: This is a search algorithm that is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It combines the benefits of breadth-first search (which finds the shortest path) and uniform-cost search (which avoids expanding paths that are too expensive).

    Dijkstra's Algorithm: This is a search algorithm that is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It works by repeatedly relaxing the edges of the graph to find the minimum distance from the source node to all other nodes.

    Best-First Search: This is a search algorithm that expands the node that is most likely to lead to the goal. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of reaching the goal from a given node.

    Hill Climbing: This is a search algorithm that starts with an initial solution and iteratively improves it by making small, local changes. It stops when it reaches a local maximum, which may or may not be the global maximum.

    Genetic Algorithms: These are optimization algorithms that are inspired by the process of natural evolution. They involve generating a population of candidate solutions, selecting the fittest ones, and then recombining them to produce a new generation of solutions.

    Simulated Annealing: This is a search algorithm that is used to find the global minimum of a function. It works by starting with a high temperature and gradually decreasing it, allowing the search to explore a wider range of solutions at the beginning and becoming more precise as the temperature decreases.

    Ant Colony Optimization: This is a search algorithm that is inspired by the behavior of ants searching for food. It involves generating a population of "virtual ants" that explore the search space and leave a "pheromone trail" that guides the ants towards more promising solutions.

    Particle Swarm Optimization: This is a search algorithm that is inspired by the behavior of swarms of birds or fish. It involves generating a population of "virtual particles" that explore the search space and adjust their movement based on the positions and velocities of their neighbors.

The algorithm of choice is based on the use case, the goal at hand and the vision in mind
