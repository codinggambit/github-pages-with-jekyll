There are a few steps you can take to find a good lawyer for your H1-B visa matter:

    Ask for recommendations: You can ask friends, family members, or colleagues if they know of any good immigration lawyers. You can also ask your employer or other organizations that you are affiliated with for recommendations.

    Search online: You can use the internet to find immigration lawyers in your area. Look for lawyers who specialize in H1-B visas and who have experience handling cases similar to yours.

    Check the lawyer's credentials: It is important to choose a lawyer who is qualified to handle your case. Make sure that the lawyer you are considering is licensed to practice law in your state and that they have experience handling H1-B visas. You can also check the lawyer's credentials by looking for information about their education and professional experience.

    Consider the lawyer's fees: You should also consider the fees that the lawyer will charge for their services. Some lawyers may charge a flat fee for their services, while others may charge an hourly rate. Make sure you understand the fee structure before you hire a lawyer.

    Meet with the lawyer: Before hiring a lawyer, it is a good idea to meet with them in person to discuss your case. This will give you an opportunity to ask questions and get a sense of whether you feel comfortable working with the lawyer.

It is important to choose a lawyer that you feel comfortable working with and who you believe will be able to effectively represent your interests.
