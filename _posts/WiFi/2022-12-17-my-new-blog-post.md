Different WiFi Standards

There are several different WiFi standards that have been developed over the years. 
These standards specify the frequency bands, data rates, and other technical specifications of wireless networking devices. Here is a list of some of the main WiFi standards:

    IEEE 802.11b: This standard, also known as "WiFi 1," was one of the first WiFi standards and operated in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. It had a maximum data rate of 11 Mbps.

    IEEE 802.11a: This standard, also known as "WiFi 2," operated in the 5 GHz frequency band and had a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps.  

    IEEE 802.11g: This standard, also known as "WiFi 3," operated in the 2.4 GHz frequency band and had a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps.  

    IEEE 802.11n: This standard, also known as "WiFi 4," operated in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands and had a maximum data rate of 600 Mbps.  

    IEEE 802.11ac: This standard, also known as "WiFi 5," operated in the 5 GHz frequency band and had a maximum data rate of 1.3 Gbps.  

    IEEE 802.11ax: This standard, also known as "WiFi 6," operates in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands and has a maximum data rate of 10 Gbps.  

It's worth noting that these standards are not mutually exclusive, and many WiFi devices support multiple standards. For example, a WiFi router may be able to support both 802.11n and 802.11ac, depending on its hardware and firmware.
