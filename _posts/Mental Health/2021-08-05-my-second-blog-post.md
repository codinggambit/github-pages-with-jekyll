Need for Positive Affirmations:  

Positive Affirmation can be used as a tool to help improve self-esteem or confidence levels by repeating statements that are intended to have a positive impact on oneself and one's life. It has been shown through research studies, such as the work of Dr. Maxwell Maltz who wrote "Psycho Cybernetics", that affirmations can be effective in changing negative thought patterns into more constructive thoughts which lead to better outcomes for individuals or groups.
