Firmware design is the process of creating the low-level software that controls a device.   

It is typically integrated into the device's hardware and provides the necessary control and functionality to interact with the device's hardware components.

Basic concepts in firmware design include:

    Microcontroller programming: Writing code in a low-level language like C or Assembly to control the microcontroller's behavior.

    Interrupt handling: Responding to events that require immediate attention.

    Communication protocols: Defining the methods for communicating between the device and other devices or systems.

    Memory management: Allocating and managing the device's limited memory resources.

    Power management: Optimizing the device's power consumption to extend battery life or minimize power usage.

    Error handling: Detecting and responding to errors or exceptional conditions.

    Debugging and testing: Debugging the firmware and testing it to ensure it works as intended.
