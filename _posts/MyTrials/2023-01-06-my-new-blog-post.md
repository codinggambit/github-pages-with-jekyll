What is the difference between Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence projects?

Data Science is a field that involves using statistical and computational techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data. It encompasses a wide range of tasks, such as data cleaning, visualization, and exploration, as well as advanced methods like predictive modeling and machine learning.

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that involves building systems that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It includes a wide range of techniques, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as deep learning.

Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses a broad range of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, as well as more advanced techniques like neural networks and deep learning.

A project in Data Science might involve using a variety of techniques to explore and analyze a dataset, while a machine learning project might involve training a model to make predictions based on that data, and an Artificial Intelligence project might involve building a complete system that can perform a range of human-like tasks using the techniques from Machine Learning and other AI techniques.
